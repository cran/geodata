This geospatial asset is a probability map of cropland presence across Sub-Saharan Africa. The AI strategy here used a neural network that was trained on an initial 1-million point Geosurvey (https://geosurvey.qed.ai) conducted in 2015. 

The map was generated by the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project, and is shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License.
